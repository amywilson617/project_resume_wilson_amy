# Resources

* [Scroll Up JQuery Plugin](https://markgoodyear.com/2013/01/scrollup-jquery-plugin/)
* This plugin creates a background image that covers the page that slowly fades back and forth between two images. It is the same image, just rotated.

* [Backstretch JQuery Plugin](http://www.jquery-backstretch.com/)
* This plug generates a button at the bottom of the page when you scroll all the way to the bottom, and when you click it is smoothly brings you back to the top of the page.

*  Other than the JQuery above, I	did	not	use	any
resources	outside	of	the	lectures	and	my	notes	on	this	assignment.


# Deductions
* "I	reviewed	the	list	of	deductions	for	this	project
and	in	the	syllabus."

# Comments
* Fun assignment!

# Custom Javascript
* My custom Javascript adds a bold font-weight and a thick gray border to the footer upon clicking on it.
